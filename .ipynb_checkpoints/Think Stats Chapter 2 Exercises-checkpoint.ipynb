    "- To get a story on the evening news, I would use the high value counts (greater than 40 weeks). These values show a high volume of pregnancies that went well beyond the 42-week \"maximum\". To reassure an anxious patient I would show the histogram of pregnancy lengths to show there is variability in pregnancy terms, but that their prgenancy is normal if they are worried.\n",
    "- On average, first babies arrive 13 hours later than other babies. However this average is only a 0.2% difference from the typical pregnancy term, signifying there is no real difference between fist babies' and other babies' arrival time."
